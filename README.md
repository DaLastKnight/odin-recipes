## Reflection and thoughts by creator

### 2/11/24 Completion of learning basics of HTML

Learning HTML, it was pretty fun! I got to do my own research and also learn get a better idea on how to structure my code, which will come in handy when it comes to 
web design. However, it was a bit tedious when I had to find my information, even copy-pasting was difficult too! Due to the formatting that the allrecipes website used, I was unable to simply copy-paste the recipe details from my web browser to VSCode, so the workaround I had to do was paste at the address bar of the search engine and then copy-paste it from there. Also, doing the same thing for 2 recipes straight was a bit dull, but fortunately, doing the Odin-Recipes project with music made it more interesting. Overall, my experience learning HTML was a blast! I hope I am able to say the same thing when learning CSS and Javascript!
